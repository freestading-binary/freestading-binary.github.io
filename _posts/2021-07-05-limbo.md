# A introduction to Limbo programming language

Limbo is the programming language for the Inferno operating system.
Limbo looks like C programming language,it has a number of features that
make it easier to use,safer,and more suited to the heterogeneous,networked
Inferno environment: rich set of basic types,strong typing,garbage collection,
concurrency,communications,and modules. Limbo is compiled in JIT (just in time),
for efficient,portable execution.

"Simplicity and clarity are first and most important, since almost everything else
 follows from them."

-   Kernighan & Pike, â€˜The Practice of Programming

**\*** Host operating systems:
Windows NT, 2000, 9x, Me
